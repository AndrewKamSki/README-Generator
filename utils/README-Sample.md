  ## Installation

  To install this project, download the files from my repository at https://github.com/AndrewKamSki/README-Generator. From there you can load in the index.js file in your favorite IDE. Run an NPM install in the console to load in the correct packages, then run a node index.js to start the application and begin entering data!

  ## Usage

  This application is great for quickly creating a README file for projects with very litte time and effort from the creator. This way they can focus on the most important thing, the CODE! The great thing is, this application at least serves as a good template for the README as they can still be edited after creation
